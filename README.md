## Description
This project consists of transforming the management of a coworking space into a fluid and automated experience. Through an innovative application, the aim is to optimize access control, facilitating the real-time registration of user entries and exits. In addition, the tool will allow you to manage work room reservations and offer accurate administrative reports for more efficient decision making. All this, in an intuitive and easy-to-use environment, designed to modernize the administration of these collaborative spaces.

## Objetive
Develop a comprehensive platform for managing access and room reservations that facilitates the efficient administration of spaces, guaranteeing a fluid experience for users.

This system will allow users to register their accesses, make reservations, and consult their activity history, while administrators will be able to generate detailed reports and statistics on the use of the rooms. Through an intuitive interface and robust functionalities, it seeks to optimize the use of available resources, improve organization and provide a safe and accessible environment for all users.

- **Efficiency:** Reduce the time and effort necessary to manage access and reservations.
- **Transparency:** Provide a clear history of accesses and reservations for users and administrators.
- **Data Analysis:** Allow administrators to make informed decisions based on usage statistics.
- **Security:** Ensure that only authorized users have access to the rooms.
